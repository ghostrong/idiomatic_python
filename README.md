# Why this presentation ?

* Python is one the main two languages (another is Java)

the different syntax, even more important, the ecosystem and philosophy.

* People who interested in Python.
* People who are not familiar with Python yet, but want to.
* People who want to talk about Python with me (and others).

This talk is all about Python, but not a toturial.
