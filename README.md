### Why this presentation ?

* Transfer to Python from other languages (e.g., Java) may feel not comfortable with
the different syntax, even more important, the ecosystem and philosophy.

* People who are not familiar with Python yet, but want to.
* People who want to talk about Python with me (and others).

!! This talk is all about Python, but not a toturial.
